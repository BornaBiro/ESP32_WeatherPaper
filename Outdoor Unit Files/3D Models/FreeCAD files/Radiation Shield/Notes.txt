- Radiation Shield MUST be printed with white PETG
- Rod holder needs to be printed with 0.15mm layers, minimum of 4 perimeters

You will also need very thin piece of acrylic and epoxy glue and a very dense metal mesh for temperature sensor.

WARNING: It still does not make a good radiation shield, temp. difference Sun vs no Sun can be as high as 2Â°C! More tinkering is needed.
